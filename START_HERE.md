## What this is
Decision-OS V9 is an operational release protocol:
**Time V2 / As-of fixation + forward-only deltas**, evaluated under public-pressure conditions.

## See the outcome first
Below is an example of the gate outcome as an auditable artifact:
- **PASS / DELAY / BLOCK** (with evidence)

➡ Example output:
- `examples/decision_gate.sample.json`

## Reproduce it (optional, fork required)
1) Fork this repo
2) Actions → **Decision Gate (B-min penetration)** → Run workflow
3) Choose a scenario (pass/delay/block/...) → run → download artifacts

## If you want the supporting layer (optional)
MMAR logs disagreement / structural signals as audit residue.
