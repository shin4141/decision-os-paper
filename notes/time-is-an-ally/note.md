# Time-is-an-Ally: As-of Preserving Re-evaluation Coefficient (Genesis×Time)

## Minimal Definition (1 sentence)
**Time-is-an-Ally is not a forecasting formula.**  
It is a coefficient that **preserves as-of (time-of-decision) evaluation** and opens re-evaluation weight **only when external signals are observed**.

## Non-Use (misread prevention)
- Not a meme-prediction / price-prediction formula.
- Not a post-hoc “excuse” for failure (no hindsight absolution).
- Not an automatic amplification by the passage of time alone.

## Re-evaluation Triggers (external signals only)
Re-evaluation is permitted only when at least one of the following signals is observed:
- Adoption / deployment in real operations
- Reproduction / verification / replication
- Citations / formal references that indicate uptake
- Resolution of a previously stated falsification or contradiction

## Prototype Form (Genesis×Time)
Let:
- Talent: present capability (current value)
- Market: resonance area (surface of adoption)
- Influence: diffusion speed
- Genesis (G_index): early-gradient advantage (seeing earlier)
- t_as-of: decision timestamp (as-of)
- t_re-eval: re-evaluation timestamp
- k: calibration constant (to be estimated)

$$
A_{total}(t) =
(Talent \times Market \times Influence)\times G_{index}\times
\left[1 + k\cdot \log\left(\frac{t_{\text{re-eval}}}{t_{\text{as-of}}}\right)\right]
$$

## Notes (to avoid overclaim)
- This form does **not** claim that “time guarantees correctness.”
- The expected gain is not “one-shot accuracy,” but **long-run decision quality improvement** under disciplined re-evaluation.
- As models improve, what tends to improve is **issue extraction / signal interpretation / re-evaluation quality**, not guaranteed foresight.

## Intended Use (practical)
Record the as-of evaluation (constraints + rationale), and re-evaluate only under external signals.
This supports “trajectory thinking” (point → line) while preventing hindsight rewriting.
