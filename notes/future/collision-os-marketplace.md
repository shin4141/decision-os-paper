# Collision OS Plan (Freeze Note) — As-of 2026-01-26 JST

Status: IDEA / NOT COMMITTED.
Purpose: Preserve the plan without locking decisions.

## Core idea
A system that collides multiple OS/profiles against the same As-of Pack to extract:
- invariant structure (agreements)
- deltas (disagreements)
- missing evidence / recheck triggers

## Why it matters
- Turns disagreement into an asset (structure extraction).
- Standardizes outputs via artifacts:
  - `decision_gate.json`
  - `mmar_findings.json`

## Marketplace concept (future)
Users can publish specialized OS profiles and earn by performance:
- which LLM/model stack is used
- what the OS is specialized for
- how many runs / hours executed
- what measurable outcomes were achieved (reproductions, caught risks, useful deltas)

## Customization levers
- Collision set (which OS profiles to run)
- strength (number of models, counter-lawyer on/off, EV on/off)
- frequency (scheduled re-evaluation)
- retention (evidence packs, logs)

## Non-goals (for now)
- No SaaS build now
- No pricing decisions now
- No public claims of completion

## Next revisit condition
Revisit after V9 publication and initial distribution signals.
