# Decision-OS Papers / Notes

This directory collects the **public-facing PDFs** of the Decision-OS lineage.
All files here are linked from **Zenodo / arXiv** and anchored to GitHub as SSOT.

The series is organized as a **progressive operating system for human–AI co-reasoning**,
from structural literacy (V4) to safety (V5), canonical memory (V6), and AGI definition (V7–V8).

## Decision-OS V4 — Polaris-Origin
**Entry OS for seeing structure with AI**

- *Decision-OS_V4_Polaris-Origin.pdf*  
  Entry layer focused on **structural thinking and question design**.  
  Polaris functions as a direction-setter: it does not solve problems,  
  but orients humans toward structure before deeper OS layers.

## Decision-OS V5 — SiriusA
**Safety OS for irreversible decision-making**

- *Decision_OS_V5_SiriusA_EN_.pdf*  
  Public-facing English edition of **Decision-OS V5 (SiriusA)**.

Decision-OS V5 introduces a **policy-level confirmation layer** designed to
protect human life in safety-critical, non-medical domains.
It formalizes **human final consent** through two-step confirmation,
revoke paths, optional family multisig, and a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) authorization layer.

V5 functions as the **safety bridge** between:
- V4 (structural orientation and question design), and  
- V6 (canonical memory and phase-invariant convergence).

Its core contribution is not prediction or automation, but
**preventing irreversible harm under duress, confusion, or panic**
while preserving explicit human responsibility.

## Decision-OS V6 — PIC (Phase-Invariant Core)

### V6 Research Note (1 page)
- *Decision-OS_V6_SiriusA-PIC_Research_Note_1page.pdf*  
  **Zenodo v1** — Conceptual skeleton of the Phase-Invariant Core (PIC).  
  Introduces order-invariant merging and canonical memory.

### V6 PIC — Japanese Edition (Short Paper)
- *Decision-OS_V6_PIC_Japanese-Edition.pdf*  
  **Zenodo v2** — 8–10 page Japanese short paper extending the research note.

### V6 PIC — English Canonical Edition
- *Decision-OS_V6_PIC_English-Edition.pdf*  
  **Zenodo v3** — Complete English canonical edition integrating:
  PIC, Person×Context mapping, Sync-Awakening Theory (SAT), and Antifragile Engine (AE).

## Decision-OS V7 — Aspire Intelligence
**Operational & self-recursive definition of AGI**

- *Decision-OS_V7_Aspire_Intelligence.pdf*  
  English research-note edition defining **AGI as an operational, recursive structure**
  rather than a capability benchmark.

### V7 Core (EN)
- *Decision_OS_V7__Aspire_Intelligence_for_AGI__EN_Core.pdf*  
  Core English edition consolidating the V7 definition.

**SSOT (GitHub commit):**

## Decision-OS V8 — Research Notes

### V8 Research Note (JP)
- *Decision-OS_V8_ResearchNote_JP.pdf*  
  Control-centered view of AGI evolution, focusing on:
  **Time-Tube**, **Dependency Gradient**, and **Guardian redefinition**.

### V8 Research Note (EN)
- *Decision-OS_V8_Research_Note_A_Control-Centered_View_*.pdf*  
  English research-note edition extending the V7 lineage toward self-safe AGI.

## Notes on Canonicality
- **GitHub** serves as the SSOT for file integrity and versioning.
- **Zenodo** versions (v1–v3) indicate public archival milestones.
- PDFs are immutable once published; revisions are released as new versions.

  ## Decision-OS V7 (Core)

- PDF (EN Core): `notes/Decision_OS_V7__Aspire_Intelligence_for_AGI__EN_Core.pdf`
- SSOT (GitHub commit): 9a184a5726c619348822d159a544879030de3fde

V8 Research Note (JP): Control-centered view of AGI evolution — Time-Tube / Dependency Gradient / Guardian Redefinition.
