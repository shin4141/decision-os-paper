# Decision-OS v4 Addendum — Grounded Decision Protocol (V5-compatible Guard)

This folder contains the v4 addendum that formalizes a **grounded** decision protocol
for real-world, high-stakes actions.

## What this is
- A practical protocol to prevent irreversible mistakes: **GO / HOLD / NO**
- Designed to be compatible with the V5 Guard layer

## How to use (quick)
1. Define the decision + constraints (as-of).
2. Generate 3 scenarios (best/base/worst).
3. Evaluate expected loss and choose: **GO / HOLD / NO**
4. If uncertain or unverifiable → **HOLD** and list missing evidence.

## Files
- `v4-addendum.pdf` (main PDF)
- (optional) `onepager.md` (1-page overview for fast entry)

## Disclosure boundary
This addendum is intended to be **reproducible** without disclosing private calibration
or personal thresholds.
